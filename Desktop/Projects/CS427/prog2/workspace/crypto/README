Program 2 - Public-Key Cryptosystem

Generates a public/private key set and uses them to encrypt and decrypt standard ascii text.


to run:

Modify the ptext.txt file with whatever text you want to encrypt/decrypt. Program will not work without this file in the workspace.
Import the project into Eclipse and run it, should work...



Other files in this archive and/or generated by this program:

pubkey.txt - public key generated by program, used for encryption
prikey.txt - private key generated by program, used for decryption
ptext.txt - input text file, used for encryption
ctext.txt - number pairs representing encrypted text
ptext2.txt - decrypted text generated by program



Possible problems:

Shouldn't run into any, I hope. I had to pad my output then strip out the padding and had some issues with that, but I think I cleared them all up.

HEADS UP: If the text input has any null terminators, they will be stripped out. This is the solution I found to deal with the padding issues.

Any other problems email me, thanks.
