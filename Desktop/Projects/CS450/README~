CS 450 - Scapegoat Tree

To run in terminal:

	go to containing directory
	python scapegoat.py < [input] > [output]

to interpret the printed tree:
	Indentation signifies the depth. The leftmost displayed value is the 		root, the next leftmost are its children, and so on. To help, I also 		had the node print their immediate children on the same line in parens.
