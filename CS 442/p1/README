Project 1 - Polygon Triangulation

This project takes a series of points (provided by the user in json format), and uses triangles to create a shape bound by those points.

To Run:
PolygonTriangulate.js < [input json] > [output json]
The output can then be submitted to 
http://ezekiel.vancouver.wsu.edu/~cs442/projects/tri/viz/drawpoly.html
which will draw the triangles with the output.
