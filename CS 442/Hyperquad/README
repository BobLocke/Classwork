Project 4 - Textured HyperQuad

This project creates a hyperquadratic shapes that holds a non-uniform texture.

To Run:
Load textured.html in a web browser.

Files Included in this archive:

textured.html - The shape
matrix.js - dependancy for textured.html
README - this readme file
face.jpg, ff6balance.png, ff6ruin.png, PathfinderMap.jpg, smiley.png - texture files to be rendered on the surface of the shape

Notes: I didn't feel like figuring out why setting a default value for the radio buttons wouldn't work, I just had the model load with a different texture. Select a texture to view.
