Project 5 - Shadows and Reflections

This project uses previously defined shapes and casts shadows and reflections onto a plane.

To Run:
Load reflect.html in a web browser.

Files Included in this archive:

reflect.html - The shape
toroid.js, hyperquad.js - shape data
matrix.js - dependancy for shapes
README - this readme file
various jpg and png files - texture files to be rendered on the surface of the shape

Notes: The Toroidal Spiral does odd things when changing the loops, this is standard behavior. Also, the sliders don't reset to default values on refresh.
